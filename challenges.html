This distinguishes <strong>current period</strong> and <strong>historical</strong> data, and means that only current period data can be changed.</p> <p>It also places constraints on the user's process, making retrospective changes cumbersome and error prone. The client required that all records for all time should be changeable, and the leave calculation should recalculate all affected records.</p> <h3 id="performance-wrt-retrospective-changes"><a href="#performance-wrt-retrospective-changes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Performance wrt retrospective changes</h3> <p>Given the above requirement, a problem arises with performance. To get a fast calculation we needed to restrict data to the smallest set possible. Finding the calculation window was a challenge due to the <strong>Advance Leave</strong> requirement (where leave can be used before it is earned).</p> <h3 id="advanced-leave"><a href="#advanced-leave" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advanced Leave</h3> <p>Advanced Leave also made it harder to work out the record processing order, i.e sequential iteration does not work.</p> <h3 id="french-legislation"><a href="#french-legislation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> French legislation</h3> <p>Legislation required all months to be “leveled” to 30 days, which meant a series of tweaks to leave earned and burned on the 31st of the month (with variations for February).</p> <h2 id="handling-data-inconsistency"><a href="#handling-data-inconsistency" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Handling data inconsistency</h2> <p>Looking at the posting data already in the database, it was apparent that some of the records represented impossible situations, e.g a seafarer posted to two vessels at the same time.</p> <p>This occurred because multiple candidate postings are entered during the rostering process, with only one posting being implemented. The unused postings were often not discarded, making after-the-fact processing such as leave calculation difficult.</p> <h2 id="incremental-changes"><a href="#incremental-changes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Incremental changes</h2> <p>Requirements were added to the list as development progressed. Partly, this was because the client was building a payroll extractor at the same time and was discovering new requirements for the leave data, which fed into the payroll system.</p> <h2 id="thirty-day-rule-french-statutory-requirement"><a href="#thirty-day-rule-french-statutory-requirement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Thirty Day Rule - French statutory requirement</h2> <p>The special calculation step known as the <strong>Thirty Day Rule</strong> was tricky as it was defined from statutory legislation (so needed some interpretation) and the impact on the model were not well understood. This feature underwent some incremental changes during development.</p> <h2 id="finance-requirements-to-fully-cost-seafarer’s-pay"><a href="#finance-requirements-to-fully-cost-seafarer’s-pay" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Finance requirements to fully cost Seafarer’s pay</h2> <p>Initially the leave earned was simply based on shifts worked, however many seafarers (particularly officers) are paid a standard salary regardless of time spent on a vessel, but are still required to follow the leave earned / leave burned model. This lead to the concept of <strong>Advanced</strong> and <strong>Anticipated</strong> vacation to fully cost these salaries.</p> <h2 id="handling-new-unspecified-activities-that-may-be-defined-in-the-future"><a href="#handling-new-unspecified-activities-that-may-be-defined-in-the-future" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Handling new (unspecified) activities that may be defined in the future</h2> <p>The client wanted new activity types to be handled by configuration options rather than application changes. This was challenging, as up to this point we had been hard-coding activity variations.</p> <h2 id="conforming-to-the-rostering-application-model"><a href="#conforming-to-the-rostering-application-model" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conforming to the Rostering application model</h2> <p>One hard limitation was the core product could not be changed in any way. A certain amount of customization is available in MAPS Rostering, in the form of soft fields in the database and VBA hooks into the UI.</p> <p>These were used to integrate the Leave Module UI seamlessly from the user perspective, but required the Leave application to run with it’s own model and use adapters to reshape data moving out and writing back to the core database.</p> <h3 id="model-adapter-extractor"><a href="#model-adapter-extractor" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Model Adapter (Extractor)</h3> <p>The Extractor pulls source records out of the database and transforms them into a format suitable for the allocation step.</p> <ul><li><p>Core <strong>Posting</strong>, <strong>Sickness</strong>, and <strong>Training</strong> records are mapped to an Activity type which is the base input record for allocation of leave.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Transits</strong> (travel days to and from a Posting or a Training Course) are attributes of the parent record. These are also mapped as activities so that rates can vary independently of the parent activity.</p></li> <li><p>Sickness periods which span posted time and leave time are treated differently. On-board, the sickness period is effectively ignored. Ashore, sickness can use up leave entitlement so these records need to be split in the activity list.</p></li> <li><p>Other reasons to split source records include award rate changes and personal change of leave group (benefit level).</p></li> <li><p>Location (OnBoard, Ashore, Home) is not a native concept to the MAPS application, but is required for leave calculation as the rates applied can be different. This requires traversal of the organization tree to the root branch which represents ships and offices.</p></li></ul> <div class="minimap-container" style="width:250px;" data-v-7ac90e02><div class="minimap" style="top:250px;zoom:25%;" data-v-7ac90e02><div data-v-7ac90e02></div></div></div></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
